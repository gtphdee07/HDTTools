# RigCheck — where things stand

Working notes for picking this back up on another machine. Written 2026-08-13.

## ✅ Done: portability pass (implemented 2026-08-13)

Full plan at `~/.claude/plans/i-would-like-to-toasty-dusk.md` on the
machine that ran it (won't exist elsewhere — summarized here). Goal:
make RigCheck portable to additional hosting types (Streamlit, eventually
Android), decided as **no shared hosted backend** — each platform is
self-contained.

- **Web app (`web/` + `src/hdttools/api/`) is now database-free.**
  `api/store.py` and the SQLite `rigs`/`checks` tables are gone.
  `POST /api/checks` became stateless `POST /api/breakdown` (no `rig_id`,
  no persistence). Rigs are now a client-side "last 5" list
  (`web/src/recentRigs.ts`, `localStorage`, keyed by a user-typed
  nickname, storing the full reviewed truck/trailer data so picking a
  remembered rig skips straight to the Scale Ticket step). Check history
  is session-only (gone on refresh) — this was a deliberate simplification,
  not an oversight.
- **New self-contained Streamlit app** (`streamlit_app/`) — same wizard
  flow, single Python process, no FastAPI/HTTP hop, imports
  `hdttools`'s OCR-parsing and breakdown logic directly. Recent rigs
  persist to `~/.rigcheck/recent_rigs.json` instead of a database. See
  `streamlit_app/README.md`.
- **`hdttools/__init__.py`** now tolerates a missing `tkinter` (wraps the
  desktop CLI reader imports in try/except) since it isn't always present
  on headless/minimal Python builds — relevant if Streamlit or the API
  ever runs somewhere without it.
- **`ocr_common.py`**'s Tesseract path detection now also checks common
  macOS/Linux install locations, not just Windows.
- **Android**: high-level roadmap only, not started. Decided: fully
  native (Kotlin/Compose), no OCR at all — reference images + manual
  entry instead, no network/API-key dependency. Needs its own
  Android Studio/Gradle project (doesn't exist in this repo).
  `compute_breakdown`/`verdict_for` would need a Kotlin port —
  `tests/test_breakdown.py`'s scenarios are the shared spec to check any
  port against.

54 backend tests pass; frontend typechecks/builds clean; Streamlit
smoke-tested end-to-end against the real `ExampleDocs/` photos.

**Note found during this pass, not fixed:** `ExampleDocs/GooseTag.jpg`
and `ExampleDocs/AddieTag.jpg` are swapped relative to what their names
suggest — `GooseTag.jpg` is actually the Brinkley RV **trailer** tag and
`AddieTag.jpg` is the Ford **truck** tag (opposite of the CAT ticket's
"TRACTOR # GOOSE TRAILER # ADDIE"). Didn't rename them since that wasn't
part of the ask, but any future test/demo code should use them this way
around.

## ✅ Done: axle-count / tongue-weight plan (implemented 2026-08-13)

Two logic-fault fixes were designed and approved in the session that wrote
this file, and implemented in the following session (different machine,
after `git pull`). Plan text below is kept as a record of what was built;
see `tests/test_breakdown.py` for the five tests covering all four
scenarios (default axle count, custom axle count, tongue weight omitted,
tongue weight provided, clamp-at-0), plus updated `models.py`,
`database.py`, `api/schemas.py`, `mockData.ts`, and `types.ts`. All 55
backend tests pass; frontend typechecks and builds clean.

**The two faults:**
1. `compute_breakdown()` hardcodes a 2-axle trailer (`gawr_per_axle * 2`)
   regardless of the trailer's actual axle count.
2. "Trailer Total (GVWR)" always excludes tongue weight (an acknowledged
   approximation from the original design — no tongue-weight field exists
   on either tag).

**Agreed fix**, both fields **optional with graceful fallback** to today's
behavior when left blank, and the tongue-weight estimate **folds into the
existing "Trailer Total (GVWR)" card** rather than getting a new one:

- Add `axle_count: int | None = None` to `TrailerTagData`
  (`src/hdttools/models.py`) — user-typed during trailer review (not
  OCR-derivable), field def added to `web/src/mockData.ts`'s `MODULES[2]`.
  `breakdown.py`: `gawr_per_axle * int(trailer.get("axle_count") or 2)`,
  with a note that's dynamic ("Trailer axle rating: N axle(s)...") when
  provided vs. today's "Assumes a 2-axle trailer..." when defaulted.
- Add `standalone_weight_lb: float | None = None` to `TruckTagData`
  (lb-only, no `_kg` counterpart — matches `ScaleTicketData`'s weight
  fields) — user-typed during truck review, field def added to
  `MODULES[1]`. `breakdown.py`: when provided, `tongue_weight =
  max(0.0, (steer + drive) - standalone_weight_lb)` (clamped at 0 — a
  negative estimate is physically meaningless and would understate the
  trailer total, the wrong direction for a safety check), and
  `trailer_total_actual = trailer_axle + tongue_weight` with an updated
  note explaining the estimate. When blank, keep today's exact behavior
  and note unchanged.
- Mirror both new fields into `src/hdttools/database.py`'s
  `_TRAILER_TAG_COLUMNS`/`_TRUCK_TAG_COLUMNS` and
  `src/hdttools/api/schemas.py`'s `TrailerTagOut`/`TruckTagOut`, for
  consistency (CLI persistence, API schema completeness) even though OCR
  won't populate them.
- **No other frontend code changes needed** — `ReviewStep.tsx` and
  `App.tsx`'s `createCheck` already handle `MODULES[step].fields`
  generically, so the two new field defs are sufficient to get working
  input rows end to end.
- New `tests/test_breakdown.py` (currently `compute_breakdown`/
  `verdict_for` only have indirect coverage via one `test_api.py` case):
  default-2-axle case, custom axle count, stand-alone weight omitted vs.
  provided, and the clamp-at-0 edge case (stand-alone weight larger than
  the hitched total).
- Verify against the real `ExampleDocs/` photos again after: blank vs.
  filled-in axle count changes the "Trailer Axle(s)" limit/note correctly;
  blank vs. filled-in stand-alone weight changes the "Trailer Total" actual
  value/note correctly.

**Explicitly deferred** (your idea, agreed as a good eventual direction
but not this round): reading a *second* CAT scale ticket (unhitched) so
`standalone_weight_lb` comes from an actual measurement instead of a typed
number. The math in `compute_breakdown` won't need to change again for
this — only where `standalone_weight_lb` comes from.

## What exists right now

**Frontend** (`web/`, React + Vite + TS): all 7 RigCheck screens, wired to a
real backend (no more mocked data). `npm install && npm run dev` — runs on
`localhost:5173`.

**Backend** (`src/hdttools/api/`, FastAPI): OCR-only extraction (Tesseract,
no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) for truck tags, trailer tags, and CAT scale
tickets, plus stateless breakdown computation (`POST /api/breakdown`) —
no persistence, no database. `uv run uvicorn hdttools.api.main:app
--reload --port 8000` — runs on `localhost:8000` (`/docs` for Swagger UI).

**Streamlit** (`streamlit_app/`): same wizard flow, self-contained, no
separate backend process — see `streamlit_app/README.md`.

Both web-app processes are already set up in `.claude/launch.json` in the
**RVSafetyCheck** directory (not this repo) if you're continuing in that
same Claude Code session/workspace — otherwise just run the commands
above.

Full pipeline is verified end-to-end against the real photos in
`ExampleDocs/` (not synthetic data): upload → OCR extract → editable
review → computed pass/fail verdict → shows up in session History/
Dashboard. 54 backend tests pass (`uv run pytest -q`).

## Fresh-machine setup checklist

On a machine that hasn't run this before:
1. `brew install uv tesseract node` (all three were missing on this Mac
   when this phase started — don't assume they're present).
2. `cd HDTTools && uv sync` (Python deps) and `cd web && npm install` (JS
   deps).
3. `git pull` to get this commit if you're setting up a second machine.

## Known limitations (intentional, not bugs)

- **Uploaded photos aren't persisted.** OCR'd in memory, discarded after
  extraction — only the reviewed field values get saved. If you want to
  revisit a check's original photo later, this would need to change.
- **OCR accuracy is real-world-imperfect**, same caveat as the pre-existing
  `scale_ticket_ocr.py`. Confirmed two live examples during testing:
  - Compliance labels sometimes drop a digit entirely (e.g. "8000" →
    "800" on the trailer tag's GAWR) — this is Tesseract misreading the
    photo itself, not a parsing bug, and there's no real regex fix for it.
  - "LB" gets misread as "1B"/"L8" etc. on tight kerning — this one *was*
    fixable and is now handled (`_kg_lb`'s trailing-unit pattern in both
    `truck_tag_ocr.py` and `trailer_tag_ocr.py` tolerates it, with a
    regression test in `test_truck_tag_ocr_parsing.py`).
  - VIN and tire-spec fields are the least reliable (not shown in the web
    review form at all, so this doesn't block anything — only 4 fields per
    document actually surface in the UI: manufacturer + the 3 weight
    figures).
- **No mobile layout, no drag-and-drop upload** (click-to-browse file input
  only) — matches the original design handoff's stated scope.
- **Not hosted anywhere yet** — local dev only, per your instruction this
  round. Since the backend is now stateless (no database), hosting it is
  simpler than before — no managed Postgres/persistence question to
  answer, just getting the process running somewhere with
  `apt-get install tesseract-ocr` available (Render was the earlier
  recommendation, Docker-based).

## Natural next steps, roughly in order

1. **Try it against more real labels.** Only one truck-tag manufacturer
   (Ford) and one trailer manufacturer (Brinkley RV) have been tested.
   Other manufacturers' compliance labels will have different layouts —
   expect to extend `truck_tag_ocr._parse_fields` /
   `trailer_tag_ocr._parse_fields` with more pattern variants as you feed
   it real photos of your actual rig.
2. **Android**, if you want to pick that up — see the portability section
   above for the decided approach (native, no OCR, reference-image +
   manual entry). Needs an Android Studio/Gradle project set up first;
   nothing in this repo blocks starting that.
3. **Decide on hosting** when ready to move off `localhost` for the web
   app — see the note above, or revisit if requirements have changed.
4. Nothing currently blocks day-to-day local use — both the web app and
   the Streamlit app are functional as-is for testing your own rig's
   numbers.
